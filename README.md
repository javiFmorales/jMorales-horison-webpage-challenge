# jMorales-horison-webpage-challenge

The original HTML and CSS files have been restructured to improve accesibility.

A list of requirements was provided to meet the desired structure of the code, to accomplish this the following changes were made:

  The title of the website was changed to www.horison-social-solutions.com.

  Spacing and indentation was added for better readability, also semantic elements were added to make the code easy to read and easier to navigate through, some of those elements include HEADER, MAIN, SECTION, FIGURE and FOOTER. 

  Some elements "selectors" were change to a name that better described what element that class would affect, such elements were: The class "hero" was changed to "background image" to show what element that class was applying css styling to.
 
  Comments were added describing the changes made to both HTML and CSS documents, this was made to facilitate understanding for new developers and show each element function and add a description to why certain changes were main.

  "Alt" attributes were given to the "img" tags for better accesibility

  The link to the "search engine optimmization" was fixed by giving an id of "search engine otimization" to the div wrapping the section of the same name.

  CSS classes were consolidated to give the document a better flow and to eliminate unnecessary redundant styling.
